# Physk: Physics Experiments

## Project Overview
Physk is a simple web-based platform for interacting with physics experiments like Projectile Motion and Pendulum Simulation. It uses Flask as the web framework and Python libraries like `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scipy` to perform physics calculations and generate visualizations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
- plotly

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/physk.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd physk
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Application
To run the application locally, use the following command:

| python app.py

Then open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Experiments
- **Projectile Motion**: Visualize the motion of a projectile based on initial velocity and angle.
- **Pendulum Simulation**: Simulate a simple pendulum's motion using differential equations.
